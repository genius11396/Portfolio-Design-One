						<p>
							The Thanboddhay monastery near Monywa is a unique temple in Burma. It is one of the most intricately decorated temples in the country with an extensive use of vibrant colors housing over 500,000 Buddha images.
							There was a monastery here as early as the 14th century, of which nothing is left. Construction of the current temple started in 1939 and was completed in 1952. During the second World War thousands of people trying to get away from the war lived on the temple grounds.During Tazaungmone, the 8th month of the Burmese calendar which marks the end of the rainy season and the start of the winter (usually November) the pagoda festival is held with musical performances, dancing, lots of food and vendors selling their wares.

						<p>
							The Sagaing District is squarely in the arid zone so it receives scant rain. But the big rivers like the Ayeyarwady, the Chindwin, and the Mu are a great help as the cool breeze from the riverside makes for a pleasant climate. It is rather sultry in March and April only.
							The region is significant because there had appeared royal cities — Sagaing, Pinya, and Innwa — after the fall of Bagan. Those ancient cities, as well as the Sagaing Hills, are still adorned with numerous beautiful pagodas and religious edifices thanks to devout Myanmar kings and people.

						<p>
							The Soon Oo Pon Nya Shin Pagoda is located at the top of Nga Hpar (Frog Hill), so named for its shape, though it is often simply called Ponnya Shin hill in honor of its pagoda. Its name is a combination of "U Ponnya", a 14th century minister, and the word "soon", which is a reference to meals. It is popularly believed that whomever attempts to be the first each day to offer a meal in honor of the Buddha will always be upstaged by heavenly deities who have already presented their offerings.The temple was supposedly established in 1312 by Amatkyi U Ponnya, a junior minister in service of King Thihathu (1265-1325), the co-founder of the Myinsaing Kingdom and later, the founder of the Pinya Kingdom which co-existed with the short-lived Sagaing Kingdom in the early-mid 14th century.

						<p>
							The Mingun Bell is a bell located in Mingun, Sagaing Region, Myanmar. It is located approximately 11 km (6.8 mi) north of Mandalay on the western bank of the Irrawaddy River. It was the heaviest functioning bell in the world at several times in history.The weight of the bell is 55,555 viss (90,718 kilograms or 199,999 pounds). This number is conveniently remembered by many people in Myanmar as a mnemonic "Min Hpyu Hman Hman Pyaw" (မင်းဖြူမှန်မှန်ပြော), with the consonants representing the number 5 in Burmese astronomy and numerology. The weight of the bell and its mnemonic words are written on the surface of the bell in white.

						<p>
							The Mingun Pahtodawgyi is an incomplete monument stupa in Mingun, approximately 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) northwest of Mandalay in Sagaing Region in central Myanmar (formerly Burma). The ruins are the remains of a massive construction project begun by King Bodawpaya in 1790 which was intentionally left unfinished. The pahtodawgyi is seen as the physical manifestations of the well known eccentricities of Bodawpaya. He set up an observation post on an island off Mingun to personally supervise the construction of the temple.

						<p>
							The U Min Thonze Cave Temple is located in the hills of Sagaing across the river from the former capital of Amarapura (part of today's Mandalay city). Tradition holds that it was established by King Tarabya I (r. 1323/27-1335/36) of the short-lived Sagaing kingdom. Its fate in subsequent centuries is unclear but it was reconstructed by King Pagan (r. 1846-53) in 1847 as part of a general restoration of monuments which ended prematurely with the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Burmese War in 1851. A contemporary depiction of the monument in Pagan's era may be seen on a mural painting in the north hall of the Kyauktawgyi of Amarapura, a new temple built by King Pagan on the lines of the Ananda Temple. The painting suggests that the U Min Thonze's current appearance is faithful to its 19th century reconstruction.

						<p>
							Maha Bodhi Ta Htaung is a famous Buddhist region and monastery located in Monywa Township, Sagaing Region, Myanmar (Burma).
