						<p>
							Nothing wrong with the monastery; it's interesting and beautiful in many ways. You are made very welcome to walk round and see life in the monastery it's just that the lunchtime or should I say the second and final meal of the day is sometime of a spectacle with a number of tourists lining up watching the 300 or so boys and men line up and take their meal. I felt a bit intrusive to be honest. What was better was getting out of the way and seeing and speaking to the people in the kitchens and also in the main hall where a number of the younger boys were preparing for exams at small desks lined up in rows. Interesting place, worth looking round for an hour but intruding on whilst they eat is a bit much for me.

							<li>
								This pgoda is a bit different to the others, due to its inner chamber going around it and hosting 64 Buddha statues. As these however are of little historic or artistic value, the visit is mainly a religious affair, and not really a must for history or arts lovers. 
							</li>
							<li>
								When it is in special full moon day and other special holidays in Myanmar, a lot of local pilgrimages spend their holiday with fun like drinking Toddy palm juice with family and friends, swimming in small creek. Shopping for local products. Especially for local but for the foreigner who want to explore how local having fun on their holidays.
